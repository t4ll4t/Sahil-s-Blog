The most profound insights often come from the simplest practices.

## The Practice

Each morning, I sit for ten minutes. No apps, no guided meditations—just silence and attention. This isn't about achieving a particular state or clearing the mind. It's about showing up.

## What I've Learned

1. **Consistency over intensity**: Five minutes daily beats an hour once a week.
2. **Presence is portable**: The practice extends beyond the cushion.
3. **Thoughts are weather**: They come and go. We are the sky.

## The Challenge

The hardest part isn't the sitting—it's remembering to sit. Life gets busy. Priorities shift. But the practice remains, waiting patiently.
