Most people overthink investing.

## The Complicated Path

- Stock picking
- Market timing
- Sector rotation
- Options trading
- Crypto speculation

Each requires expertise, time, and emotional fortitude. Most people have none of these.

## The Simple Path

1. **Low-cost index funds**: Own the market, not individual stocks.
2. **Automated contributions**: Set it and forget it.
3. **Long-term horizon**: Time in the market beats timing the market.

That's it. Three principles that outperform 90% of active strategies.

## Why It Works

Simplicity reduces:
- Decision fatigue
- Emotional trading
- Fees and taxes
- Time spent managing

Complexity is a feature for financial advisors. For you, it's a bug.
