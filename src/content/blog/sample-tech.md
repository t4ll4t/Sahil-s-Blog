The web has become unnecessarily complex.

## The Modern Web

- React for a blog
- Next.js for static content
- GraphQL for simple queries
- Docker for local development

We've built entire ecosystems to solve problems that don't exist.

## The Astro Approach

[Astro](https://astro.build) brings back simplicity:

- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Ship only what you need
- **Markdown-first**: Write content, not components
- **Fast by default**: Static generation with minimal overhead
- **Framework-agnostic**: Use React, Vue, or nothing at all

## The Result

This blog loads in under 100ms. No hydration, no client-side JavaScript, no tracking scripts. Just HTML and CSS.

Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one.
