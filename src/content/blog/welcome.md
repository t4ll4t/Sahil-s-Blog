Hi, I'm Sahil.

This is my corner of the internet where I write about three things that occupy most of my thinking: spirituality, money, and technology.

## Why these three?

They might seem unrelated, but I've found they share a common thread: all three reward patience, discipline, and first-principles thinking.

**Spirituality** — I follow the path of Sant Mat (RSSB). The daily practice of meditation has taught me more about patience and consistency than anything else. I write about what I'm learning on this inner journey.

**Money** — I'm fascinated by investing, markets, and building wealth the right way. Not get-rich-quick schemes, but understanding how value actually compounds over time. Think Buffett and Dalio, not day trading.

**Technology** — I build things. AI systems, automation workflows, and whatever else captures my attention. Tech is the machine that amplifies everything else.

## What to expect

Short essays. No fluff. I write to clarify my own thinking, and I share it in case it helps you too.

New posts when I have something worth saying — not on a schedule.
