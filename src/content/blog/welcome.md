Welcome to my personal blog. This is a space where I share thoughts on **spirituality**, **finance**, **technology**, and occasional miscellany.

## What to Expect

- **Spirituality**: Reflections on meaning, purpose, and inner growth
- **Finance**: Thoughts on money, investing, and financial independence
- **Tech**: Observations on software, systems, and the digital world
- **Misc**: Everything else that doesn't fit neatly into categories

I write for myself first, but if you find value here, you're welcome to stay.

## Why This Format?

I've chosen a minimalist design because I believe in:
- **Clarity over decoration**
- **Content over complexity**
- **Reading over distraction**

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) for speed and simplicity. No JavaScript frameworks, no tracking scripts—just words on a page.

Thanks for reading.
